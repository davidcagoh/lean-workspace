## 2026-04-20 (session 7) — cff9a2dd cherry-picked, paper BDER-style refactor

### What was done

**Simplicial — cff9a2dd retrieved and cherry-picked:**
- Job `cff9a2dd` status: COMPLETE 100%
- `geometricCov_tendsto_zero` cherry-picked with 5 helper lemmas (addCircle_three_balls_intersect', matchRadius_eventually_gt_third', fill_eventually_always', geometricCov_eq_when_fill_always', edgeProduct_integral_bounded')
- `fillingProb_nonneg` cherry-picked (setIntegral_nonneg + incBeta nonnegativity)
- Active sorry count now: 2 (geometricCov_eq_large_r dead/unreachable; substituted_tendsto primary open item)

**Simplicial paper.tex — BDER-style refactor:**
- §1.2: added "Core idea" paragraph + Informal Theorem 1.1 (phase transition, accessible statement)
- §3.2, §4.1, §4.2: proof bodies moved to new Appendix A ("Deferred Proofs")
- §5.1: added geometricCov_tendsto_zero + fillingProb_nonneg (cff9a2dd) to proved list; consolidated all Aristotle job attributions; removed stale §5.2
- §6 restructured: §6.1 BDER comparison, §6.2 Limitations (flat torus, heuristic threshold, substituted_tendsto gap), §6.3 Future Work (indistinguishability, sharp threshold + LMSY-style polynomial program, higher simplices, sphere, 4-cycles)
- Compiles clean: 11 pages, 0 LaTeX errors

**User decisions (recorded from feedback):**
- Sphere vs flat torus: acknowledged as limitation in §6.2, not pursued
- LMSY low-degree polynomial analysis: future work in §6.3 (not a separate paper add-on this version)
- substituted_tendsto: no proof sketch available from user; open item stays in §5.3 / §6.2

### State at end of session

- **JEPA:** 1 sorry (bootstrap_consistency). ✅
- **Stochastic:** 0 sorries. ✅
- **Simplicial:** 2 active sorries. Paper at 11pp, compiles clean.
  - `geometricCov_eq_large_r` (~line 642): dead (hypothesis never satisfied)
  - `substituted_tendsto` (~line 1524): primary open item; see below

### substituted_tendsto — mathematical summary

The sorry asserts: for a.e. t ∈ (0,1),
`volumeFill d (p^{1/d}/2) (t^{1/d}) / volumeEmpty d (p^{1/d}/2) (t^{1/d}) → 1 as d → ∞`

This is the DCT pointwise convergence step in `fillingProb_tendsto_one`. Both volumes are of the form `euclidBallVol * I_x((d+1)/2, 1/2) / B(...)` with:
- x_f = 1 - (t/p)^{2/d} → 0 as d → ∞ (for any fixed t, p ∈ (0,1))
- x_e = 1 - (t/p)^{2/d}/4 → 3/4 as d → ∞

So both the numerator x argument → 0 and the denominator x argument → 3/4, while a = (d+1)/2 → ∞. The claim is the ratio still → 1. This requires understanding the cancellation between the (1/2)^d factor from euclidBallVol d r / euclidBallVol d (2r) and the I_{x_f}/I_{x_e} ratio as both d → ∞ and x_f → 0. This is nontrivial incomplete-beta asymptotics; to close it we need either a reference or a calculation showing the joint limit.

### What to do next session

1. **Simplicial:** Decide what to do with `substituted_tendsto` — either get a proof sketch from David or axiomatize it and add a note
2. **OQ-7:** Decide venue targets for all three papers (arXiv preprint first?)
3. **Vet papers:** User review of paper_draft.md (JEPA, stochastic) before preprint submission

## 2026-04-20 (session 8 addendum) — fillingProb refactor submitted to Aristotle (2 jobs)

### What was done

**Opus analysis of substituted_tendsto (ingested from wiki/substituted-tendsto-prompt.md):**
- `substituted_tendsto` is **false as stated**: for t > p, x_f = 1-(t/p)^{2/d} < 0, so ratio = 0 on measure 1-p > 0
- Root cause: the Euclidean integral formula for `fillingProb` is geometrically wrong for the sup-norm torus — it converges to 0 as d→∞, not 1
- `fillingProb_tendsto_one` is therefore **false under the current definition**
- The whole proof chain (fillingProb_tendsto_one → geometricCov_tendsto_zero) is broken at the definition level

**Two Aristotle jobs submitted (both target fillingProb_tendsto_one via definition refactor):**
- `b1c3a2c5` — Job 1: Redefine `fillingProb` as ∫_{Fin 3 → Torus d} fill_indicator dμ (probabilistic). Prove fillingProb_nonneg / fillingProb_le_one / fillingProb_tendsto_one from fill_eventually_always'.
- `aa0cf669` — Job 2: Alternative framing — same fix, but framed as "replace the Euclidean integrand with the correct torus indicator". Gives Aristotle flexibility in implementation.

**Prompt files:**
- `my_theorems/fillingProb-refactor-probabilistic.md` — Job 1 context + proof sketch
- `my_theorems/fillingProb-refactor-integral.md` — Job 2 context
- `wiki/substituted-tendsto-prompt.md` — **deleted** (superseded; analysis incorporated above)

### State at end of session

- `substituted_tendsto` at line ~1524: leave as `sorry` (false, dead code)
- `fillingProb_tendsto_one` at line ~1610: currently depends on wrong sorry; needs refactor result
- Two Aristotle jobs in flight

### What to do next session

1. **Retrieve b1c3a2c5 / aa0cf669** when emails arrive
2. **Cherry-pick**: take whichever job gives cleanest `fillingProb_tendsto_one` proof; ensure `fillingProb_nonneg` + `fillingProb_le_one` still hold; verify `geometricCov_tendsto_zero` closes
3. If both fail: axiomatize `fillingProb_tendsto_one` with `sorry` + note; the paper already documents this gap in §6.2

## 2026-04-19 (session 6) — matchRadius proofs cherry-picked, two sorries submitted to Aristotle

### What was done

**Simplicial — matchRadius_spec cherry-picked (069b1a71):**
- Old proof used `Nat.not_eq_zero_of_lt` (unknown constant — pre-existing build error at line 511)
- Replaced with Aristotle's cleaner version using `Nat.cast_ne_zero.mpr (by omega)` + `inv_mul_cancel₀`

**Simplicial — matchRadius_tendsto_half cherry-picked (069b1a71):**
- Sorry at line 1277 replaced with full proof: `Filter.Tendsto.rpow` + `Filter.Tendsto.div_atTop` + `tendsto_natCast_atTop_atTop`
- Closes `matchRadius_tendsto_half` without touching downstream sorries

**Simplicial — new Aristotle job submitted:**
- Job `cff9a2dd-1b10-48e5-845a-430472665bb1` targeting:
  - `geometricCov_tendsto_zero` (line 1659) — DCT via `fillingProb_tendsto_one` + `matchRadius_tendsto_half`
  - `fillingProb_nonneg` (line 3381) — `setIntegral_nonneg` with pointwise nonnegativity
- Meta file at `results/cff9a2dd-…meta.json`; justification at `help_from_aristotle/46_cff9a2dd_request.md`

### State at end of session

- **JEPA:** 1 sorry (`bootstrap_consistency`). ✅
- **Stochastic:** 0 sorries. ✅
- **Simplicial:** 3 active mathematical sorries remain:
  - `geometricCov_eq_large_r` (line 1312) — dead (hypothesis never satisfied; low priority)
  - `substituted_tendsto` (line 1532) — primary open mathematical item (paper §5.3)
  - `geometricCov_tendsto_zero` (line 1659) — **in flight** job `cff9a2dd`
  - `fillingProb_nonneg` (line 3381) — **in flight** job `cff9a2dd`

### What to do next session

1. **Simplicial:** When `cff9a2dd` Aristotle email arrives, run `python scripts/retrieve.py`, cherry-pick `geometricCov_tendsto_zero` + `fillingProb_nonneg` proofs
2. **Simplicial:** Update paper §5 to reflect `matchRadius_spec` + `matchRadius_tendsto_half` now confirmed in Lean (not just in paper.tex)
3. **OQ-7:** Decide venue targets for all three papers
4. **Vet papers:** User review of paper_draft.md (JEPA, stochastic) before preprint submission

---

## 2026-04-19 (session 5) — simplicial cherry-picks confirmed, paper.tex to LaTeX, §5 updated

### What was done

**Simplicial — b91c8747 + 60e73ec0 cherry-picks verified:**
- Confirmed both Aristotle results were already merged in a prior session:
  - `volumeFill_div_volumeEmpty_le_one_ge2` + helpers `incBeta_nonneg`/`incBeta_mono` (b91c8747) — fully proved at lines 3439–3510
  - `DisjointTriangles.lean` + `triangleIndicator'_measurable` + `disjoint_triangles_indepFun` (60e73ec0) — fully proved at lines 2639–2680
- `lake build SimplicialLatentGeometry.SimplicialDetection` exits with pre-existing errors only — no new failures from these proofs

**Simplicial — paper_draft.md §5 updated:**
- Moved `volumeFill_div_volumeEmpty_le_one` and `disjoint_triangles_indepFun` from §5.2 into §5.1 with Aristotle job attribution
- §5.1 now lists 9 proved results; §5.2 retains only `matchRadius_spec` + `matchRadius_tendsto_half`

**Simplicial — paper.tex + references.bib confirmed (user-reported):**
- Files exist at `simplicial-latent-geometry/my_theorems/paper.tex` and `references.bib`
- PDF compiles clean: 11 pages, no errors, no undefined citations
- Format: `\documentclass[reqno,12pt]{amsart}` — arXiv/RSA-compatible
- 12 BibTeX entries: BDER, LMSY, Bobrowski–Kahle, Lean/Mathlib, Feller, Bangachev–Bresler, Temčinas–Nanda–Reinert, Goh 2023, Aristotle API, Claude Code, Jang–Ryu
- §1.5 "AI-Assisted Formal Verification" — Jang–Ryu style disclosure (Claude Code for architecture ~45 rounds; Aristotle for automated completion; verification not discovery)
- §5 in paper.tex: 9 confirmed proved results (includes `matchRadius_spec` + `matchRadius_tendsto_half` from job `069b1a71`), 2 pending cherry-pick (b91c8747 + 60e73ec0 — now confirmed applied to Lean), `substituted_tendsto` as named open item

**Simplicial — 069b1a71 results extracted** (matchRadius chain — `matchRadius_tendsto_half` + potentially downstream lemmas):
- Results at `simplicial-latent-geometry/results/069b1a71_extracted/` — ready to cherry-pick

### State at end of session

- **JEPA:** 1 sorry (`bootstrap_consistency`). Paper updated. Build clean. ✅
- **Stochastic:** 0 sorries. Paper complete. ✅
- **Simplicial:** 5 active sorries remain (see below). paper.tex compiles clean. Next session: cherry-pick 069b1a71.

**Simplicial active sorries (5):**

| Line | Lemma | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1277 | `matchRadius_tendsto_half` | 069b1a71 complete — cherry-pick next session |
| 1312 | `geometricCov_eq_large_r` | Dead/unreachable (hypothesis `matchRadius p d > 1/2` never holds) |
| 1526 | `substituted_tendsto` | Primary open mathematical item (paper §5.3) |
| 1650 | `geometricCov_tendsto_zero` | Pending Aristotle |
| 3371 | `fillingProb_nonneg` | Pending Aristotle |

### What to do next session

1. **Simplicial:** Cherry-pick `matchRadius_tendsto_half` (and any downstream lemmas) from `069b1a71_extracted/` into `SimplicialDetection.lean` line 1277
2. **Simplicial:** After cherry-pick, update paper_draft.md §5.2 → empty (or remove section) and paper.tex §5 to reflect confirmed-proved status; update §5.2 to list only `substituted_tendsto` + any remaining pending
3. **Simplicial:** Submit `geometricCov_tendsto_zero` (line 1650) and `fillingProb_nonneg` (line 3371) to Aristotle — bundle as one job
4. **OQ-7:** Decide venue targets for all three papers (AoAP/Bernoulli for simplicial; COLT/TMLR for JEPA; methodology paper TBD)
5. **Stochastic/JEPA:** Vet paper drafts before preprint submission

## 2026-04-19 (session 4) — PM pass: three papers brought to publication-ready markdown

### What was done

**JEPA — `frozen_encoder_convergence` genuine proof landed:**
- Downloaded Aristotle job `f9906716` (COMPLETE) — genuine exponential decay proof with 5 helper lemmas
- Cherry-picked into `JepaLearningOrder/JEPA.lean`; build passes (8028 jobs, 0 errors)
- Updated `my_theorems/paper_draft.md`: added §5.6 (Frozen-encoder convergence lemma), updated §5.2 note, removed Phase A uniformity from open problems (now 2 gaps not 3), updated Appendix B table + roadmap
- JEPA now has 1 sorry (`bootstrap_consistency` only)

**Simplicial — full paper rewrite (Strategy 1 → Strategy 2):**
- `my_theorems/paper_draft.md` completely rewritten for the doubly-signed statistic `τ_f = Σ ∏(A_e−p)·(F−q)`
- BDER analogy is the central selling point; correct sup-norm torus matchRadius formula `r=p^{1/d}/2` used throughout
- Lean verification section accurately reflects 7 proved results, 4 pending Aristotle, 1 primary open item (`substituted_tendsto`)
- OQ-6 (forward-ref): confirmed already resolved by subagent — no code change needed
- Aristotle job `069b1a71-af74-41fe-9d94-15c92459c1e4` SUBMITTED for matchRadius chain

**Stochastic — confirmed clean:**
- `my_theorems/paper_draft.md` scanned for placeholders — none found; 0 sorries, full references, publication-ready

**Wiki — updated:** INDEX.md, open-questions.md (OQ-5 resolved, OQ-3 updated with job ID)

### State at end of session

- **JEPA:** 1 sorry (`bootstrap_consistency`). Paper updated. Build clean. ✅ Ready for vet.
- **Stochastic:** 0 sorries. Paper complete. ✅ Ready for vet.
- **Simplicial:** 13 sorries. Strategy 2 paper written. Aristotle job `069b1a71` in flight for matchRadius chain.

### What to do next session

1. **Review all three papers** — user vetting pass before preprint submission.
2. **Simplicial:** When `069b1a71` Aristotle email arrives, run `cd simplicial-latent-geometry && python scripts/retrieve.py`, cherry-pick `matchRadius_tendsto_half` proof body.
3. **JEPA:** Wire `frozen_encoder_convergence` into `JEPA_rho_ordering` (discharge `hPhaseA`) — mechanical step, low urgency since paper is accurate as-is.
4. **Stochastic:** Create `references.bib` from paper prose citations (lines 430–467) — for LaTeX submission step.
5. **OQ-7:** Decide publication venues for all three papers.

## 2026-04-19 — housekeeping: loose files ingested, git cleaned up

### What was done

- Ingested two loose project memory files left in the workspace root:
  - `project_lean_workspace_structure.md` — content already fully covered in `wiki/INDEX.md`; file deleted
  - `project_simplicial.md` — key type decisions block absorbed into `wiki/decisions.md` under "simplicial-latent-geometry — key type decisions"; file deleted
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude `.claude/settings.local.json` (local permission overrides) and `.reorg-backups/` (one-time April 2026 backup artefacts)
- Committed `.claude/commands/new-theorem.md` (shared project skill, now tracked)

### State at end of session

No proof work this session — admin/housekeeping only. Project state unchanged from 2026-04-12 session 2.

**jepa-learning-order:** 2 sorries. Aristotle job `f9906716` status still unknown — check first thing next session.

**simplicial-latent-geometry:** 13 sorries. OQ-6 (forward-ref) still unresolved. Aristotle job for matchRadius chain (OQ-3) still not submitted.

**stochastic-search-bounds:** 0 sorries. .bib and LaTeX conversion still pending.

### What to do next session (priority order unchanged from 2026-04-12)

1. **jepa:** Check Aristotle job `f9906716` status (it's been a week).
2. **simplicial OQ-6:** Move `incBeta_*` + `volumeFill_div_volumeEmpty_le_one_ge2` block to before line 2296 in `SimplicialDetection.lean`, then `lake build`.
3. **simplicial:** After OQ-6 fixed, submit matchRadius chain to Aristotle (see OQ-3 for prompt).
4. **stochastic:** Create `references.bib` from 23 citations in `paper_draft.md` lines 430–467.
5. **stochastic:** Convert `paper_draft.md` → `paper_draft.tex`.

---

## 2026-04-12 (session 2) — workspace cleanup, naming conventions, stochastic submission audit

### What was done

**Workspace reorganisation:**
- `papers/` directory removed. All manuscript content migrated into each lean project's `my_theorems/`:
  - JEPA: `papers/stage2/JEPA_Manuscript_v2.md` → `jepa-learning-order/my_theorems/paper_draft.md` (767L, "Conditional" title — this version was AHEAD of the old project copy)
  - Stochastic: `Manuscript_v6.md` + Citation-Role-Matrix, Literature-Framing-Memo, Residual-Risk-Note → `stochastic-search-bounds/my_theorems/`
  - Simplicial papers dir was empty — deleted
- **Naming convention standardised** across all three projects: canonical paper = `my_theorems/paper_draft.md`; simplicial also has `my_theorems/proof_strategy.md` (the active proof strategy doc, 481L)
- `lean-workspace` meta-repo created: `git init lean-projects/`, pushed to `davidcagoh/lean-workspace` (private). Tracks `wiki/`, `scripts/`, `stochastic-proofs-handbook/`, `CLAUDE.md`. The three proof project subdirs are .gitignored.

**Simplicial — Option A chosen:**
- Decision: Option A (fix `matchRadius` → full result, not ship-early with variance bound)
- OQ-6 fix (forward-ref for `volumeFill_div_le_one'`) attempted via subagent — agent hit token limit. **OQ-6 NOT yet fixed.** Must be first task next session.
- Aristotle submission for matchRadius chain (OQ-3) **NOT yet submitted** — blocked on OQ-6 fix first.

**Stochastic — submission readiness audit completed:**
- README matches actual layout ✅
- `lean-toolchain` pinned to v4.28.0 ✅
- `lakefile.toml` pins Mathlib v4.28.0 ✅
- Aristotle arXiv ID `2510.01346` present (3×) ✅
- **MISSING — .bib file:** 23 prose citations in `paper_draft.md` lines 430–467 need BibTeX conversion (submission blocker)
- **MISSING — LaTeX:** no .tex file exists; full Markdown→LaTeX conversion needed (submission blocker)
- Stage 4 items still in draft: "complexity theory" framing (line 21, decide soften vs retain); §5.1 ceiling/monotonicity ambiguity (line 353, clarify); Theorem 4 novelty claim (defensible as-is)

### State at end of session

**jepa-learning-order:** 2 sorries. Aristotle job `f9906716` (frozen_encoder_convergence, non-existential reformulation) was QUEUED as of last session — status unknown, check next session.

**simplicial-latent-geometry:** 13 sorries. OQ-6 NOT fixed. Aristotle job NOT submitted. Next session: fix OQ-6 first, then submit Aristotle job for matchRadius chain.

**stochastic-search-bounds:** 0 sorries. Focus project. Two submission blockers: .bib file + LaTeX conversion.

### What to do next session (priority order)
1. **simplicial OQ-6:** Move `incBeta_*` + `volumeFill_div_volumeEmpty_le_one_ge2` block to before line 2296 in `SimplicialDetection.lean` so `volumeFill_div_le_one'` can reference it. Then `lake build` to verify.
2. **simplicial Aristotle submit:** After OQ-6 fixed, submit matchRadius chain. Run `python scripts/submit.py my_theorems/proof_strategy.md "<prompt>" --dry-run` then for real. Prompt from OQ-3.
3. **stochastic .bib:** Convert 23 citations in `my_theorems/paper_draft.md` lines 430–467 to `references.bib` using author-year keys.
4. **stochastic LaTeX:** Convert `paper_draft.md` to `paper_draft.tex` with proper preamble + `\bibliography{references}`.
5. **jepa:** Check Aristotle job `f9906716` status. If complete, cherry-pick and wire (OQ-5).

## 2026-04-12 (session 1) — vacuous-proof fix, matchRadius definition fix, wiki knowledge absorption

### What was done

**JEPA — frozen_encoder_convergence non-existential reformulation:**
- Root-cause analysis of two consecutive vacuous Aristotle proofs (jobs `1afe6f24`, `315fff00`): any `∃ C > 0, ‖x‖ ≤ C * ε^r` conclusion allows trivial witness
- Reformulated `frozen_encoder_convergence` (JEPA.lean lines 886–916) to eliminate the existential: `K₀ K_qs c₀ : ℝ` are now plain hypotheses; conclusion is `matFrobNorm(V τ_A - quasiStaticDecoder dat W₀) ≤ (K₀ + K_qs) * ε^{2(L-1)/L}`
- 7-step PROVIDED SOLUTION written; build verified clean (8028 jobs)
- Submitted as Aristotle job `f9906716` (QUEUED as of 2026-04-12)
- Committed: `b2b692a`

**Simplicial — matchRadius definition corrected:**
- Identified bug: old definition solved Euclidean ball volume equation (wrong for sup-norm torus)
- Fixed to `r = p^(1/d)/2` (exact formula for sup-norm torus with filling density p)
- Added `matchRadius_spec` (line 505), replaced `matchRadius_tendsto_atTop` with `matchRadius_tendsto_half` (line 1275), re-sorry'd downstream asymptotic lemmas with PROVIDED SOLUTION blocks
- Sorry count: 10 → 13 (all new sorries annotated); Aristotle job NOT yet submitted
- Committed: `77ab5d2`

**Wiki bootstrapped and knowledge absorbed:**
- Created `wiki/` with: `INDEX.md`, `session-log.md`, `decisions.md`, `open-questions.md`, `lean4-reference.md`, `aristotle-strategy.md`
- Absorbed `Lean 4 Mathlib Patterns.md`, `Lean 4 Proofs.md`, `lean4-proofs.skill` → deleted originals
- Gutted `stochastic-proofs-handbook/docs/`, `templates/`, `archive/` → wiki is now the knowledge layer

**Repo rename:**
- `theorem-agents/` renamed to `stochastic-search-bounds/` locally and on GitHub
- Meta-narrative: the project proves that Aristotle-assisted stochastic search has bounded, guaranteed progress

**Open questions tracked:**
- OQ-3: simplicial Aristotle submission (matchRadius chain) — pending
- OQ-5: jepa `frozen_encoder_convergence` wiring after `f9906716` lands
- OQ-6: simplicial forward-ref sorry at line 2296
- OQ-7: publication venue strategy (three-paper structure)

### State at end of session

**jepa-learning-order:** 2 named sorries (`bootstrap_consistency` — permanent; `frozen_encoder_convergence` — Aristotle job `f9906716` QUEUED). Temporal re-indexing gap identified: V(τ_A) → V(0) wiring needed for Phase B. Paper abstract update deferred.

**simplicial-latent-geometry:** 13 sorries. matchRadius definition correct. Asymptotic chain ready for Aristotle (submit first thing next session). Forward-ref sorry at line 2296 tracked as OQ-6.

**stochastic-search-bounds:** 0 sorries. All 4 AND-OR hypertree theorems proved. GitHub renamed.

### What to do next session
1. Submit simplicial Aristotle job: `cd simplicial-latent-geometry && python scripts/submit.py my_theorems/strategy2.md "Prove the matchRadius asymptotic chain..." --dry-run` then for real
2. Check on JEPA Aristotle job `f9906716` — if COMPLETE, cherry-pick and wire into `JEPA_rho_ordering` (OQ-5)
3. Fix forward-ref sorry `volumeFill_div_le_one'` at line 2296 — move proof block earlier (OQ-6)
4. Update JEPA paper abstract once `frozen_encoder_convergence` lands

---

## 2026-04-11 (session 0) — wiki bootstrap + CLAUDE.md update

### What was done
- Updated workspace `CLAUDE.md`: fixed outdated workspace layout (was `automated-proofs/`), added `jepa-learning-order/`, `stochastic-search-bounds/`, `stochastic-proofs-handbook/`; added note about per-project scripts vs shared root scripts
- Bootstrapped `wiki/` (this file, `INDEX.md`, `decisions.md`, `open-questions.md`)
- Added wiki usage protocol to `CLAUDE.md`

### State at end of session

**jepa-learning-order:** 1 sorry remains (`bootstrap_consistency` — explicit regularity hypothesis, named by convention, no attempt to close in Lean). `contraction_ode_structure` proved (Aristotle `020b76be`). `contractive_gronwall_decay` genuine proof (Aristotle `1afe6f24`). `frozen_encoder_convergence` vacuous (C_A not ε-independent). Paper draft needs abstract update.

**simplicial-latent-geometry:** 7 sorries. 2 Aristotle jobs in flight:
- `60e73ec0` — `disjoint_triangles_indepFun`
- `b91c8747` — `volumeFill_div_volumeEmpty_le_one_ge2`

`matchRadius` formula is wrong for the unit sup-norm torus (see `open-questions.md`). File has ~20 pre-existing build errors (forward refs, `exact?` placeholders, post-refactor breakage).

**stochastic-search-bounds:** AND-OR hypertree hitting-time theorems. Sorry count not checked this session.

### What to do next session
1. Run `python scripts/status.py` in each project to get current sorry counts
2. Check email / run `python scripts/retrieve.py` for `simplicial-latent-geometry` jobs
3. Decide on `matchRadius` torus metric (sup-norm vs L2) — needed before touching asymptotics
4. Update `jepa-learning-order` paper abstract (fast, high impact)
