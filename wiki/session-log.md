## 2026-04-23 (session 16) — paper.tex §1 restructured (9 subsections → 5), principles distilled from BDER

### What was done

**Principles distilled from `existing-literature/1411.5713v2.pdf` (BDER):**
1. State all main theorems in intro, numbered and formally — reader knows what the paper proves before any proof
2. Related work comes **before** main results (reader gets landscape first)
3. Never separate "Main Results" and "Contributions" into distinct subsections — they overlap
4. Comparison with prior work in ONE place (briefly in related work OR fully in discussion, not both)
5. Proof dependencies communicated by section structure + one-sentence roadmap, not a diagram
6. Notation introduced at point of first use, not in standalone section
7. Intro ends with single prose roadmap paragraph

**paper.tex Section 1 restructure (9 subsections → 5):**
- Old 1.1 Motivation + 1.2 Detection Problem → **new 1.1 Background and Motivation** (merged; 2PC + Čech defined once informally)
- Old 1.6 Related Work moved up to **new 1.2 Related Work**, with BDER qualitative contrast ($d^*\asymp n^3$ vs. finite $d^*(p)$) absorbed as one paragraph
- Old 1.3 Main Results + 1.4 Contributions → **new 1.3 Main Results and Contributions** (unified; τ_f definition + equation + informal theorem + 4-item contributions list all in one subsection)
- Old 1.5 Comparison with BDER **deleted entirely** (content already in new 1.2 briefly and in §5.1 Discussion in depth)
- Old 1.7 Proof Dependency Structure (raw-LaTeX arrow diagram) **deleted**; flow now one sentence inside new **1.4 Paper Organization**
- Speculative BDER power conjecture moved to §5.3 Future Work as `\paragraph{Power comparison with BDER}`
- Old 1.9 AI-Assisted renumbered to 1.5, unchanged

**Paper state after:** 930 lines, 13 pages, compiles clean (pdflatex + bibtex + pdflatex × 2), no undefined references, no multiply-defined labels. Two main theorems (detection bound, phase transition) now sit together in §1.3, clearly spotlighted.

**Plan file:** `~/.claude-main/plans/i-feel-that-simplicial-latent-geometry-m-declarative-yeti.md`

### State at end of session

paper.tex §1 clean. Still ready for arXiv + RSA submission.

### What to do next session

1. **Simplicial — arXiv upload:** submit `paper.tex` + `references.bib` (no figures needed). Paper is now 13pp (was 14pp — the restructure tightened §1).
2. **Simplicial — RSA submission:** PDF via Wiley ScholarOne after arXiv ID assigned.
3. **OQ-7:** JEPA and stochastic-search-bounds venue targets still open.
4. **JEPA:** Wire `frozen_encoder_convergence` into `JEPA_rho_ordering` (discharge `hPhaseA`) — low urgency.

## 2026-04-23 (session 15) — citations verified; references.bib corrected (5 DOIs added, Temcinas fixed)

### What was done

- Set up and ran `verify_refs.py` (dropped in workspace root) against `simplicial-latent-geometry/my_theorems/references.bib`
- Installed deps: `bibtexparser httpx python-dotenv`
- Fixed `verify_refs.py`: `_extract_arxiv()` now scans `note`/`journal` fields for arXiv IDs — without this, 7 entries that store their IDs in `note`/`journal` were falling through to slow title search and some failing
- Final result: **11 VERIFIED, 1 LIKELY (Feller1968 — expected, old book), 0 UNCERTAIN, 3 NOT_FOUND (all expected: Goh2023 unpublished, Aristotle2025/ClaudeCode2025 website refs)**

**references.bib corrections:**
- Added `doi = {10.1002/rsa.20633}` to Bubeck2016
- Added `doi = {10.1145/3519935.3519989}` to Liu2022
- Added `doi = {10.1007/978-3-030-79876-5_37}` to deMoura2021
- Added `doi = {10.1145/3372885.3373824}` to Mathlib2020
- `Temcinas2025` fully corrected: wrong title ("Hypothesis Testing in Topology") → "Goodness-of-fit via count statistics in dense random simplicial complexes"; wrong arXiv journal → `Foundations of Data Science`; added `doi = {10.3934/fods.2025013}`; removed spurious arXiv:2407.05006 (mapped to a Turkic NLP paper on S2)

**paper.tex correction (line 327):**
- Updated Temcinas citation description from "study hypothesis testing directly in the TDA pipeline" → "develop goodness-of-fit tests for random simplicial complexes via CLTs for subcomplex counts" (matches actual paper content)

**Temcinas paper confirmed relevant:** "Goodness-of-fit via count statistics in dense random simplicial complexes" (FODS 2025) proves multivariate CLTs for subcomplex counts in a multi-parameter model and uses them to build goodness-of-fit tests — directly related to our null-hypothesis testing framing.

### State at end of session

Citations fully verified. bib is 15 entries, all accurate. Paper compiles clean. Ready for arXiv + RSA submission.

### What to do next session

1. **Simplicial — arXiv upload:** submit `paper.tex` + `references.bib` (no figures needed).
2. **Simplicial — RSA submission:** PDF via Wiley ScholarOne after arXiv ID assigned.
3. **OQ-7:** JEPA and stochastic-search-bounds venue targets still open.
4. **JEPA:** Wire `frozen_encoder_convergence` into `JEPA_rho_ordering` (discharge `hPhaseA`) — low urgency.

## 2026-04-23 (session 14) — paper.tex major rewrite for arXiv; all proofs expanded, citations fixed, intro restructured

### What was done

**paper.tex — complete rewrite (11pp → 14pp, compiles clean):**
- Running-head fixed: `\author[Goh and Cook]{David Goh}` (was plain `\author{David Goh}`)
- Eliminated Appendix A (deferred proofs) — all three proofs brought into main body sections
- Introduction restructured following BDER paper style: hypotheses stated immediately, informal theorem early (§1.3), reader sees all contributions before proofs
- New §1.1 Motivation: TDA context from Kahle 2010/2016 and Bobrowski-Kahle survey; null-hypothesis framing explicit
- New §1.6 Related Work: B&B Fourier coefficients paper, Dhawan-Mao-Wein dense subhypergraphs, Kahle papers, Temčinas et al.
- New §1.7 Proof dependency diagram (explicit arrows from supporting lemmas to two main theorems)
- BDER comparison (§1.5): added conjecture that simplicial fill layer gives greater test power than BDER setting
- Prop 2.7 renamed to **Lemma 2.7** (stepping-stone role, not standalone result)
- New **Lemma 2.8** (three-arc intersection): named, with complete case-split proof ($r > 1/3$ and $r = 1/3$ boundary)
- Lemma 2.7(b) proof: self-contained Helly argument replaces sketch; shows geomCov = 0 *exactly* for d ≥ d*(p) (finite threshold), so limit is trivially 0
- Prop 3.2 proof: off-diagonal vanishing argued case-by-case (all configurations of shared vertices/edges)
- Prop 3.3(b) proof: translation-invariance argument that E[Z_t | x_i] is constant in x_i spelled out explicitly (change-of-variables u = x_j − x_i on T^d)
- Thm 4.2 proof: Paley-Zygmund lower bound computed explicitly (denominator = 1 − o(1) shown)
- Discussion §5.3: "4-cycle statistics" paragraph completely rewritten; no longer references a hallucinated paper

**references.bib — complete rewrite:**
- Removed bogus `Bangachev2024` entry (had fictitious arXiv:2304.01521, wrongly attributed "Detection of Dense Subhypergraphs" to Bangachev & Bresler)
- Added `BangachevBresler2024`: "On the Fourier Coefficients of High-Dimensional Random Geometric Graphs", arXiv:2402.12589 — the actual B&B paper
- Added `DhawanMaoWein2023`: "Detection of Dense Subhypergraphs by Low-Degree Polynomials", arXiv:2304.08135 (Dhawan, Mao, Wein)
- Added `Kahle2011`: Duke Math J 2011, arXiv:0910.1649 — Random Geometric Complexes
- Added `Kahle2016`: handbook chapter arXiv:1607.07069 — Random Simplicial Complexes
- Total bib entries: 16 (was 12)

**Citation investigation findings (from reading PDFs):**
- 2402.12589 = Bangachev & Bresler 2024: Fourier coefficients of RGG on S^{d-1}; proves signed triangle statistic is computationally optimal
- 2304.08135 = Dhawan, Mao, Wein 2023: dense subhypergraphs detection (NOT Bangachev & Bresler)
- Old bib arXiv number 2304.01521 does not match any provided PDF — was hallucinated

### State at end of session

Paper substantially revised for arXiv submission: 14pp, 0 errors, 16 bib entries, all proofs in main body, running head fixed. No Lean changes.

### What to do next session

1. **Verify citations with Semantic Scholar API** (user has API key ready): check all 16 bib entries for accuracy (authors, title, year, venue).
2. **arXiv upload:** `paper.tex` + `references.bib` (no figures needed).
3. **RSA submission:** PDF via Wiley ScholarOne; no house style required for round 1.
4. **OQ-7:** Decide JEPA and stochastic-search-bounds venue targets.

---

## 2026-04-22 (session 13) — paper.tex reviewed; running-head fix and arXiv/RSA submission still pending

### What was done

- Reviewed `simplicial-latent-geometry/my_theorems/paper.tex` (mtime updated Apr 22).
- Content confirmed unchanged from session 12: two authors (Goh + Cook), affiliations, AI disclosure, Lean catalog, all correct.
- No code or proof changes. Lean sorry count remains 0.
- Running-head TODO (`\author[Goh and Cook]{David Goh}` optional arg) confirmed still unresolved.

### State at end of session

Clean. Paper in submission-ready state except for the one-line running-head fix.
No in-progress Lean work.

### What to do next session

1. **Fix running head:** change `\author{David Goh}` → `\author[Goh and Cook]{David Goh}` in paper.tex author block (line 96).
2. **arXiv upload:** `paper.tex` + `references.bib` (no figures needed).
3. **RSA submission:** PDF via Wiley ScholarOne; no house style required for round 1.
4. **OQ-7:** Decide JEPA and stochastic-search-bounds venue targets.

---

## 2026-04-20 (session 12) — paper.tex authorship + AI disclosure updated; root CLAUDE.md slimmed; wiki completed

### What was done

**paper.tex — authorship and AI disclosure:**
- Added Nicholas A. Cook (Dept. of Mathematics, Duke University) as co-author
- David Goh affiliation: Dept. of Computer Science, University of Toronto; email → `daveed@cs.toronto.edu`
- AI section renamed "AI-Assisted Mathematical Development"; now states Claude Code + Aristotle API assisted both mathematical discovery AND formal verification, following Jang–Ryu (2026) precedent
- Acknowledgements updated: Cook is co-author not thanked; "author" → "authors"; PRUV at Duke University
- Paper compiles clean (pdflatex, no errors)

**references.bib:**
- `Goh2023`: author → `David Goh and Nicholas~A. Cook`; institution → Duke University (was Princeton)

**Venue decision:** RSA (Random Structures and Algorithms) chosen as top-choice target for simplicial paper — same community as BDER, "follow-up" framing is natural. AoAP as prestige fallback if proof techniques are deemed dense enough.

**Root CLAUDE.md slimmed:**
- Cut from ~300 lines to ~30; everything project-specific now lives in project CLAUDEMDs and wiki
- Orphaned content (Lean env options, Python setup, aristotlelib API, result file structure) moved into wiki where it belongs

**Wiki completed:**
- `wiki/lean4-reference.md`: added "Environment" section (toolchain, Mathlib version, standard Lean options)
- `wiki/aristotle-strategy.md`: added Setup, Python API, CLI, and Result File Structure sections

### State at end of session

- **Simplicial:** paper.tex 12pp, compiles clean, two authors with affiliations. Ready for arXiv upload + RSA round-1 submission. One minor TODO: add `\author[Goh and Cook]{...}` running-head fix for amsart two-author display.
- **Lean:** unchanged from session 11 — 0 active sorries.
- **JEPA:** unchanged. **Stochastic:** unchanged.

### What to do next session

1. **Fix running head:** add `\author[Goh and Cook]` to paper.tex author block.
2. **arXiv upload:** `paper.tex` + `references.bib` (no figures).
3. **RSA submission:** PDF via Wiley ScholarOne; no house style needed for round 1.
4. **OQ-7:** JEPA and stochastic-search-bounds venue targets still open.

## 2026-04-20 (session 11) — OQ-9 resolved: exact zero phase transition proved + full paper.tex update

### What was done

**Mathematical discovery — OQ-9 resolved (and corrected):**
- The proposed decay rate geomCov(p,d) = Θ(|log p|/d) was WRONG, not just unproved.
- Correct structure: sharp phase transition at d*(p) = |log p|/log(3/2) ≈ 2.47|log p|.
  - For d ≥ d*(p): matchRadius > 1/3 → every triple fills (1D Helly on AddCircle) → fillingProb = 1 exactly → geometricCov = 0 exactly. No signal, detection impossible regardless of n.
  - For d < d*(p): geometricCov > 0. Detection succeeds when n^{3/2}·geomCov → ∞.
- The threshold is finite and CONSTANT IN n (unlike BDER's n^3-growing threshold).

**New Lean lemmas (both typecheck, 0 sorries):**
- `fillingProb_eventually_one` (private, line ~1372): ∀ᶠ d, fillingProb p d = 1. Extracted from fillingProb_tendsto_one proof; uses fill_eventually_always'.
- `geometricCov_eventually_zero` (public, line ~1501): ∀ᶠ d, geometricCov p d = 0. Uses fillingProb_eventually_one + geometricCov_eq_when_fill_always' + ring.
- Fixed parse error: `open MeasureTheory in` must precede, not follow, a `/-- -/` docstring.

**paper.tex — complete update (12pp, compiles clean):**
- Informal theorem: rewritten with correct d*(p) form + itemized detectable/collapsed regimes
- Contributions (3): d*(p) = |log p|/log(3/2), exact-zero collapse, 1D Helly argument
- Contributions (4): removed "open mathematical question" — formalization IS complete
- §1.2 BDER comparison: d*(p) constant-in-n vs. BDER's n^3-growing threshold
- §4.3 Phase Transition: theorem (b) now states geometricCov = 0 exactly (was: SNR→0)
- §4.4 Explicit Threshold: complete rewrite — geometric derivation of d*(p), concrete values table (p=0.1→d*≈5.7, p=0.01→d*≈11.4), corrected BDER comparison
- §5.1 Lean results: added geometricCov_eventually_zero bullet (leanverified); fixed choose3_g_sq_tendsto_atTop description
- §6.1 BDER discussion: exact-zero collapse (ours) vs. gradual-decay (BDER), 1D Helly explanation
- §6.2 Limitations: removed "Heuristic threshold" paragraph (threshold is now proved, not heuristic)
- §6.3 Future work: renamed "Sharp threshold" → "Detection rate below the threshold"
- Appendix Theorem (b): proof now uses exact-zero argument (geometricCov = 0 → identical distributions) instead of SNR→0 Pinsker argument

### State at end of session

- **Simplicial:** 0 active Lean sorries. 3 sorries in dead Strategy 1 code (lines 385, 435, 645 — do not touch). paper.tex complete and mathematically correct. Paper IS submittable.
- **OQ-9:** RESOLVED. The correct result is d*(p) = |log p|/log(3/2), proved in Lean as geometricCov_eventually_zero.
- **JEPA:** unchanged (1 sorry, bootstrap_consistency). **Stochastic:** unchanged (0 sorries).

### What to do next session

1. **Submit paper:** Proofread paper.tex one final time (especially §4.3, §4.4, and appendix theorem (b) proof). Pick venue (AoAP / Bernoulli / EJP) and submit.
2. **OQ-7:** Decide venue targets — simplicial is now unblocked.
3. **JEPA:** Wire `frozen_encoder_convergence` into `JEPA_rho_ordering` (discharge `hPhaseA`).

## 2026-04-20 (session 10) — paper intro rewritten; BDER gap identified; decay rate plan (OQ-9)

### What was done

**paper.tex — intro rewrite (self-contained, BDER as precedent not premise):**
- Abstract: rewritten to open from random simplicial complexes + geometry detection question; BDER cited as parallel result, not framing device
- §1.1: full rewrite — networks → simplicial complexes → 2PC null model → Čech geometric model → detection question → BDER as prior art
- §1.2 "Core idea": rewritten to explain two-layer centering from scratch, no BDER assumed
- Abstract: corrected "precise asymptotics" → "precise decay rate"; corrected "remaining open item in formalization" → "open mathematical question" (formalization IS complete)
- §1.2 contribution (4): same correction
- §5.1: removed duplicate `geometricCov_tendsto_zero` entry

**CLAUDE.md (simplicial-latent-geometry):**
- Stripped to stable-only content (type table, commands, architecture)
- Removed stale sorry state / conundrum sections
- Added redirect to wiki at top
- Source of truth for state is now wiki only

**Wiki:**
- INDEX.md: updated to session 10; simplicial status now ⚠️ (paper not submittable until OQ-9 resolved)
- OQ-9 added: full plan for proving geomCov(p,d) = Θ(|log p|/d)

### Key decision: BDER analogy is incomplete

The paper proves the phase transition EXISTS (and geomCov → 0) but does NOT prove the explicit threshold d*(n,p) ~ n^{3/2}|log p|. BDER proved both. §4.4 is currently a heuristic remark, not a theorem. The paper should not be submitted until OQ-9 is resolved.

**Do NOT scratch the paper** — intro, models, statistic, moments, detection theorem, Lean section are all solid. Only §4.4 needs upgrading from heuristic to theorem.

### State at end of session

- **JEPA:** 1 sorry (`bootstrap_consistency`). ✅
- **Stochastic:** 0 sorries. ✅
- **Simplicial:** 0 active Lean sorries. Paper intro cleaned up. §4.4 heuristic — BLOCKED on OQ-9.

### What to do next session

1. **OQ-9 Step 0:** Read `SimplicialDetection.lean` around the current `fillingProb` definition to understand exactly what the torus fill indicator integral computes. Clarify whether fillingProb < 1 is possible for all r (the model may have an inconsistency with the sup-norm fill criterion — see OQ-9 caution note).
2. Once model is clear: derive upper and lower bounds on (1 - fillingProb(p,d)) as d→∞.
3. Formalize in Lean with Aristotle.
4. Upgrade §4.4 to a theorem.

## 2026-04-20 (session 9) — fillingProb refactor cherry-picked; fillingProb_tendsto_one + geometricCov_tendsto_zero now sorry-free

### What was done

**Aristotle jobs b1c3a2c5 + aa0cf669 retrieved (both COMPLETE 100%):**
- Both jobs redefined `fillingProb` as the torus fill indicator integral and proved `fillingProb_tendsto_one` via `fill_eventually_always'`
- Chose b1c3a2c5 as the primary source (cleaner `geometricCov_eq_when_fill_always'` helpers)

**Cherry-pick applied to `SimplicialDetection.lean`:**
- Replaced `fillingProb` definition (Euclidean integral → torus fill indicator integral with `open Classical in`)
- Replaced `fillingProb_tendsto_one` proof body: now uses `fill_eventually_always'` + `tendsto_nhds_of_eventually_eq`, no DCT/substitution machinery
- Moved `addCircle_three_balls_intersect'` + `matchRadius_eventually_gt_third'` + `fill_eventually_always'` to BEFORE `fillingProb_tendsto_one` (fixing forward-reference error)
- Replaced `fillingProb_nonneg'` and `fillingProb_le_one'` proofs (4-line each using `integral_nonneg`/`integral_mono_of_nonneg`)
- Added `torus_pi_measure_real_univ'` helper
- Replaced public `fillingProb_nonneg` and `fillingProb_le_one` proofs
- Added `open MeasureTheory in` before `geometricCov_eq_when_fill_always'` (was missing)
- Marked `fillingProb_eq_substituted` as sorry (dead code — now false with new definition)

**Build result:** 3 sorry warnings (down from 2 active mathematical + chain breakage):
1. `moments_cech` (line 427) — legacy Strategy 1, deprecated
2. `fillingProb_eq_substituted` (line 1375) — explicitly dead code
3. `substituted_tendsto` (line 1504) — documented as false, kept for reference

**Key proofs now sorry-free:** `fillingProb_tendsto_one`, `geometricCov_tendsto_zero`, `fillingProb_nonneg`, `fillingProb_le_one`, `fillingProb_nonneg'`, `fillingProb_le_one'`

### State at end of session

- **JEPA:** 1 sorry (`bootstrap_consistency`). ✅ Build clean.
- **Stochastic:** 0 sorries. ✅
- **Simplicial:** All active Strategy 2 sorries closed. Only 2 dead-code sorries remain (`fillingProb_eq_substituted`, `substituted_tendsto`). Build has pre-existing errors (forward refs to `choose3_g_sq_tendsto_atTop`, `chebyshev_single_bound`, `moments_twoParam_var`) unrelated to our proof chain.

### What to do next session

1. **OQ-7:** Decide publication venues for all three papers (arXiv preprint first for simplicial?)
2. **Vet papers:** User review of `paper_draft.md` (JEPA, stochastic, simplicial) before preprint submission
3. **Simplicial paper.tex:** Update §5 to reflect `fillingProb_tendsto_one` + `geometricCov_tendsto_zero` now formally proved; remove the §6.2 "gap" note about `substituted_tendsto`
4. **JEPA:** Wire `frozen_encoder_convergence` into `JEPA_rho_ordering` (discharge `hPhaseA`) — low urgency

---

## 2026-04-20 (session 7) — cff9a2dd cherry-picked, paper BDER-style refactor

### What was done

**Simplicial — cff9a2dd retrieved and cherry-picked:**
- Job `cff9a2dd` status: COMPLETE 100%
- `geometricCov_tendsto_zero` cherry-picked with 5 helper lemmas (addCircle_three_balls_intersect', matchRadius_eventually_gt_third', fill_eventually_always', geometricCov_eq_when_fill_always', edgeProduct_integral_bounded')
- `fillingProb_nonneg` cherry-picked (setIntegral_nonneg + incBeta nonnegativity)
- Active sorry count now: 2 (geometricCov_eq_large_r dead/unreachable; substituted_tendsto primary open item)

**Simplicial paper.tex — BDER-style refactor:**
- §1.2: added "Core idea" paragraph + Informal Theorem 1.1 (phase transition, accessible statement)
- §3.2, §4.1, §4.2: proof bodies moved to new Appendix A ("Deferred Proofs")
- §5.1: added geometricCov_tendsto_zero + fillingProb_nonneg (cff9a2dd) to proved list; consolidated all Aristotle job attributions; removed stale §5.2
- §6 restructured: §6.1 BDER comparison, §6.2 Limitations (flat torus, heuristic threshold, substituted_tendsto gap), §6.3 Future Work (indistinguishability, sharp threshold + LMSY-style polynomial program, higher simplices, sphere, 4-cycles)
- Compiles clean: 11 pages, 0 LaTeX errors

**User decisions (recorded from feedback):**
- Sphere vs flat torus: acknowledged as limitation in §6.2, not pursued
- LMSY low-degree polynomial analysis: future work in §6.3 (not a separate paper add-on this version)
- substituted_tendsto: no proof sketch available from user; open item stays in §5.3 / §6.2

### State at end of session

- **JEPA:** 1 sorry (bootstrap_consistency). ✅
- **Stochastic:** 0 sorries. ✅
- **Simplicial:** 2 active sorries. Paper at 11pp, compiles clean.
  - `geometricCov_eq_large_r` (~line 642): dead (hypothesis never satisfied)
  - `substituted_tendsto` (~line 1524): primary open item; see below

### substituted_tendsto — mathematical summary

The sorry asserts: for a.e. t ∈ (0,1),
`volumeFill d (p^{1/d}/2) (t^{1/d}) / volumeEmpty d (p^{1/d}/2) (t^{1/d}) → 1 as d → ∞`

This is the DCT pointwise convergence step in `fillingProb_tendsto_one`. Both volumes are of the form `euclidBallVol * I_x((d+1)/2, 1/2) / B(...)` with:
- x_f = 1 - (t/p)^{2/d} → 0 as d → ∞ (for any fixed t, p ∈ (0,1))
- x_e = 1 - (t/p)^{2/d}/4 → 3/4 as d → ∞

So both the numerator x argument → 0 and the denominator x argument → 3/4, while a = (d+1)/2 → ∞. The claim is the ratio still → 1. This requires understanding the cancellation between the (1/2)^d factor from euclidBallVol d r / euclidBallVol d (2r) and the I_{x_f}/I_{x_e} ratio as both d → ∞ and x_f → 0. This is nontrivial incomplete-beta asymptotics; to close it we need either a reference or a calculation showing the joint limit.

### What to do next session

1. **Simplicial:** Decide what to do with `substituted_tendsto` — either get a proof sketch from David or axiomatize it and add a note
2. **OQ-7:** Decide venue targets for all three papers (arXiv preprint first?)
3. **Vet papers:** User review of paper_draft.md (JEPA, stochastic) before preprint submission

## 2026-04-20 (session 8 addendum) — fillingProb refactor submitted to Aristotle (2 jobs)

### What was done

**Opus analysis of substituted_tendsto (ingested from wiki/substituted-tendsto-prompt.md):**
- `substituted_tendsto` is **false as stated**: for t > p, x_f = 1-(t/p)^{2/d} < 0, so ratio = 0 on measure 1-p > 0
- Root cause: the Euclidean integral formula for `fillingProb` is geometrically wrong for the sup-norm torus — it converges to 0 as d→∞, not 1
- `fillingProb_tendsto_one` is therefore **false under the current definition**
- The whole proof chain (fillingProb_tendsto_one → geometricCov_tendsto_zero) is broken at the definition level

**Two Aristotle jobs submitted (both target fillingProb_tendsto_one via definition refactor):**
- `b1c3a2c5` — Job 1: Redefine `fillingProb` as ∫_{Fin 3 → Torus d} fill_indicator dμ (probabilistic). Prove fillingProb_nonneg / fillingProb_le_one / fillingProb_tendsto_one from fill_eventually_always'.
- `aa0cf669` — Job 2: Alternative framing — same fix, but framed as "replace the Euclidean integrand with the correct torus indicator". Gives Aristotle flexibility in implementation.

**Prompt files:**
- `my_theorems/fillingProb-refactor-probabilistic.md` — Job 1 context + proof sketch
- `my_theorems/fillingProb-refactor-integral.md` — Job 2 context
- `wiki/substituted-tendsto-prompt.md` — **deleted** (superseded; analysis incorporated above)

### State at end of session

- `substituted_tendsto` at line ~1524: leave as `sorry` (false, dead code)
- `fillingProb_tendsto_one` at line ~1610: currently depends on wrong sorry; needs refactor result
- Two Aristotle jobs in flight

### What to do next session

1. **Retrieve b1c3a2c5 / aa0cf669** when emails arrive
2. **Cherry-pick**: take whichever job gives cleanest `fillingProb_tendsto_one` proof; ensure `fillingProb_nonneg` + `fillingProb_le_one` still hold; verify `geometricCov_tendsto_zero` closes
3. If both fail: axiomatize `fillingProb_tendsto_one` with `sorry` + note; the paper already documents this gap in §6.2

---

## 2026-04-19 (session 6) — matchRadius proofs cherry-picked, two sorries submitted to Aristotle

### What was done

**Simplicial — matchRadius_spec cherry-picked (069b1a71):**
- Old proof used `Nat.not_eq_zero_of_lt` (unknown constant — pre-existing build error at line 511)
- Replaced with Aristotle's cleaner version using `Nat.cast_ne_zero.mpr (by omega)` + `inv_mul_cancel₀`

**Simplicial — matchRadius_tendsto_half cherry-picked (069b1a71):**
- Sorry at line 1277 replaced with full proof: `Filter.Tendsto.rpow` + `Filter.Tendsto.div_atTop` + `tendsto_natCast_atTop_atTop`
- Closes `matchRadius_tendsto_half` without touching downstream sorries

**Simplicial — new Aristotle job submitted:**
- Job `cff9a2dd-1b10-48e5-845a-430472665bb1` targeting:
  - `geometricCov_tendsto_zero` (line 1659) — DCT via `fillingProb_tendsto_one` + `matchRadius_tendsto_half`
  - `fillingProb_nonneg` (line 3381) — `setIntegral_nonneg` with pointwise nonnegativity
- Meta file at `results/cff9a2dd-…meta.json`; justification at `help_from_aristotle/46_cff9a2dd_request.md`

### State at end of session

- **JEPA:** 1 sorry (`bootstrap_consistency`). ✅
- **Stochastic:** 0 sorries. ✅
- **Simplicial:** 3 active mathematical sorries remain:
  - `geometricCov_eq_large_r` (line 1312) — dead (hypothesis never satisfied; low priority)
  - `substituted_tendsto` (line 1532) — primary open mathematical item (paper §5.3)
  - `geometricCov_tendsto_zero` (line 1659) — **in flight** job `cff9a2dd`
  - `fillingProb_nonneg` (line 3381) — **in flight** job `cff9a2dd`

### What to do next session

1. **Simplicial:** When `cff9a2dd` Aristotle email arrives, run `python scripts/retrieve.py`, cherry-pick `geometricCov_tendsto_zero` + `fillingProb_nonneg` proofs
2. **Simplicial:** Update paper §5 to reflect `matchRadius_spec` + `matchRadius_tendsto_half` now confirmed in Lean (not just in paper.tex)
3. **OQ-7:** Decide venue targets for all three papers
4. **Vet papers:** User review of paper_draft.md (JEPA, stochastic) before preprint submission

## 2026-04-19 (session 5) — simplicial cherry-picks confirmed, paper.tex to LaTeX, §5 updated

### What was done

**Simplicial — b91c8747 + 60e73ec0 cherry-picks verified:**
- Confirmed both Aristotle results were already merged in a prior session:
  - `volumeFill_div_volumeEmpty_le_one_ge2` + helpers `incBeta_nonneg`/`incBeta_mono` (b91c8747) — fully proved at lines 3439–3510
  - `DisjointTriangles.lean` + `triangleIndicator'_measurable` + `disjoint_triangles_indepFun` (60e73ec0) — fully proved at lines 2639–2680
- `lake build SimplicialLatentGeometry.SimplicialDetection` exits with pre-existing errors only — no new failures from these proofs

**Simplicial — paper_draft.md §5 updated:**
- Moved `volumeFill_div_volumeEmpty_le_one` and `disjoint_triangles_indepFun` from §5.2 into §5.1 with Aristotle job attribution
- §5.1 now lists 9 proved results; §5.2 retains only `matchRadius_spec` + `matchRadius_tendsto_half`

**Simplicial — paper.tex + references.bib confirmed (user-reported):**
- Files exist at `simplicial-latent-geometry/my_theorems/paper.tex` and `references.bib`
- PDF compiles clean: 11 pages, no errors, no undefined citations
- Format: `\documentclass[reqno,12pt]{amsart}` — arXiv/RSA-compatible
- 12 BibTeX entries: BDER, LMSY, Bobrowski–Kahle, Lean/Mathlib, Feller, Bangachev–Bresler, Temčinas–Nanda–Reinert, Goh 2023, Aristotle API, Claude Code, Jang–Ryu
- §1.5 "AI-Assisted Formal Verification" — Jang–Ryu style disclosure (Claude Code for architecture ~45 rounds; Aristotle for automated completion; verification not discovery)
- §5 in paper.tex: 9 confirmed proved results (includes `matchRadius_spec` + `matchRadius_tendsto_half` from job `069b1a71`), 2 pending cherry-pick (b91c8747 + 60e73ec0 — now confirmed applied to Lean), `substituted_tendsto` as named open item

**Simplicial — 069b1a71 results extracted** (matchRadius chain — `matchRadius_tendsto_half` + potentially downstream lemmas):
- Results at `simplicial-latent-geometry/results/069b1a71_extracted/` — ready to cherry-pick

### State at end of session

- **JEPA:** 1 sorry (`bootstrap_consistency`). Paper updated. Build clean. ✅
- **Stochastic:** 0 sorries. Paper complete. ✅
- **Simplicial:** 5 active sorries remain (see below). paper.tex compiles clean. Next session: cherry-pick 069b1a71.

**Simplicial active sorries (5):**

| Line | Lemma | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1277 | `matchRadius_tendsto_half` | 069b1a71 complete — cherry-pick next session |
| 1312 | `geometricCov_eq_large_r` | Dead/unreachable (hypothesis `matchRadius p d > 1/2` never holds) |
| 1526 | `substituted_tendsto` | Primary open mathematical item (paper §5.3) |
| 1650 | `geometricCov_tendsto_zero` | Pending Aristotle |
| 3371 | `fillingProb_nonneg` | Pending Aristotle |

### What to do next session

1. **Simplicial:** Cherry-pick `matchRadius_tendsto_half` (and any downstream lemmas) from `069b1a71_extracted/` into `SimplicialDetection.lean` line 1277
2. **Simplicial:** After cherry-pick, update paper_draft.md §5.2 → empty (or remove section) and paper.tex §5 to reflect confirmed-proved status; update §5.2 to list only `substituted_tendsto` + any remaining pending
3. **Simplicial:** Submit `geometricCov_tendsto_zero` (line 1650) and `fillingProb_nonneg` (line 3371) to Aristotle — bundle as one job
4. **OQ-7:** Decide venue targets for all three papers (AoAP/Bernoulli for simplicial; COLT/TMLR for JEPA; methodology paper TBD)
5. **Stochastic/JEPA:** Vet paper drafts before preprint submission

---

## 2026-04-19 (session 4) — PM pass: three papers brought to publication-ready markdown

### What was done

**JEPA — `frozen_encoder_convergence` genuine proof landed:**
- Downloaded Aristotle job `f9906716` (COMPLETE) — genuine exponential decay proof with 5 helper lemmas
- Cherry-picked into `JepaLearningOrder/JEPA.lean`; build passes (8028 jobs, 0 errors)
- Updated `my_theorems/paper_draft.md`: added §5.6 (Frozen-encoder convergence lemma), updated §5.2 note, removed Phase A uniformity from open problems (now 2 gaps not 3), updated Appendix B table + roadmap
- JEPA now has 1 sorry (`bootstrap_consistency` only)

**Simplicial — full paper rewrite (Strategy 1 → Strategy 2):**
- `my_theorems/paper_draft.md` completely rewritten for the doubly-signed statistic `τ_f = Σ ∏(A_e−p)·(F−q)`
- BDER analogy is the central selling point; correct sup-norm torus matchRadius formula `r=p^{1/d}/2` used throughout
- Lean verification section accurately reflects 7 proved results, 4 pending Aristotle, 1 primary open item (`substituted_tendsto`)
- OQ-6 (forward-ref): confirmed already resolved by subagent — no code change needed
- Aristotle job `069b1a71-af74-41fe-9d94-15c92459c1e4` SUBMITTED for matchRadius chain

**Stochastic — confirmed clean:**
- `my_theorems/paper_draft.md` scanned for placeholders — none found; 0 sorries, full references, publication-ready

**Wiki — updated:** INDEX.md, open-questions.md (OQ-5 resolved, OQ-3 updated with job ID)

### State at end of session

- **JEPA:** 1 sorry (`bootstrap_consistency`). Paper updated. Build clean. ✅ Ready for vet.
- **Stochastic:** 0 sorries. Paper complete. ✅ Ready for vet.
- **Simplicial:** 13 sorries. Strategy 2 paper written. Aristotle job `069b1a71` in flight for matchRadius chain.

### What to do next session

1. **Review all three papers** — user vetting pass before preprint submission.
2. **Simplicial:** When `069b1a71` Aristotle email arrives, run `cd simplicial-latent-geometry && python scripts/retrieve.py`, cherry-pick `matchRadius_tendsto_half` proof body.
3. **JEPA:** Wire `frozen_encoder_convergence` into `JEPA_rho_ordering` (discharge `hPhaseA`) — mechanical step, low urgency since paper is accurate as-is.
4. **Stochastic:** Create `references.bib` from paper prose citations (lines 430–467) — for LaTeX submission step.
5. **OQ-7:** Decide publication venues for all three papers.

## 2026-04-19 — housekeeping: loose files ingested, git cleaned up

### What was done

- Ingested two loose project memory files left in the workspace root:
  - `project_lean_workspace_structure.md` — content already fully covered in `wiki/INDEX.md`; file deleted
  - `project_simplicial.md` — key type decisions block absorbed into `wiki/decisions.md` under "simplicial-latent-geometry — key type decisions"; file deleted
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude `.claude/settings.local.json` (local permission overrides) and `.reorg-backups/` (one-time April 2026 backup artefacts)
- Committed `.claude/commands/new-theorem.md` (shared project skill, now tracked)

### State at end of session

No proof work this session — admin/housekeeping only. Project state unchanged from 2026-04-12 session 2.

**jepa-learning-order:** 2 sorries. Aristotle job `f9906716` status still unknown — check first thing next session.

**simplicial-latent-geometry:** 13 sorries. OQ-6 (forward-ref) still unresolved. Aristotle job for matchRadius chain (OQ-3) still not submitted.

**stochastic-search-bounds:** 0 sorries. .bib and LaTeX conversion still pending.

### What to do next session (priority order unchanged from 2026-04-12)

1. **jepa:** Check Aristotle job `f9906716` status (it's been a week).
2. **simplicial OQ-6:** Move `incBeta_*` + `volumeFill_div_volumeEmpty_le_one_ge2` block to before line 2296 in `SimplicialDetection.lean`, then `lake build`.
3. **simplicial:** After OQ-6 fixed, submit matchRadius chain to Aristotle (see OQ-3 for prompt).
4. **stochastic:** Create `references.bib` from 23 citations in `paper_draft.md` lines 430–467.
5. **stochastic:** Convert `paper_draft.md` → `paper_draft.tex`.

---

## 2026-04-12 (session 2) — workspace cleanup, naming conventions, stochastic submission audit

### What was done

**Workspace reorganisation:**
- `papers/` directory removed. All manuscript content migrated into each lean project's `my_theorems/`:
  - JEPA: `papers/stage2/JEPA_Manuscript_v2.md` → `jepa-learning-order/my_theorems/paper_draft.md` (767L, "Conditional" title — this version was AHEAD of the old project copy)
  - Stochastic: `Manuscript_v6.md` + Citation-Role-Matrix, Literature-Framing-Memo, Residual-Risk-Note → `stochastic-search-bounds/my_theorems/`
  - Simplicial papers dir was empty — deleted
- **Naming convention standardised** across all three projects: canonical paper = `my_theorems/paper_draft.md`; simplicial also has `my_theorems/proof_strategy.md` (the active proof strategy doc, 481L)
- `lean-workspace` meta-repo created: `git init lean-projects/`, pushed to `davidcagoh/lean-workspace` (private). Tracks `wiki/`, `scripts/`, `stochastic-proofs-handbook/`, `CLAUDE.md`. The three proof project subdirs are .gitignored.

**Simplicial — Option A chosen:**
- Decision: Option A (fix `matchRadius` → full result, not ship-early with variance bound)
- OQ-6 fix (forward-ref for `volumeFill_div_le_one'`) attempted via subagent — agent hit token limit. **OQ-6 NOT yet fixed.** Must be first task next session.
- Aristotle submission for matchRadius chain (OQ-3) **NOT yet submitted** — blocked on OQ-6 fix first.

**Stochastic — submission readiness audit completed:**
- README matches actual layout ✅
- `lean-toolchain` pinned to v4.28.0 ✅
- `lakefile.toml` pins Mathlib v4.28.0 ✅
- Aristotle arXiv ID `2510.01346` present (3×) ✅
- **MISSING — .bib file:** 23 prose citations in `paper_draft.md` lines 430–467 need BibTeX conversion (submission blocker)
- **MISSING — LaTeX:** no .tex file exists; full Markdown→LaTeX conversion needed (submission blocker)
- Stage 4 items still in draft: "complexity theory" framing (line 21, decide soften vs retain); §5.1 ceiling/monotonicity ambiguity (line 353, clarify); Theorem 4 novelty claim (defensible as-is)

### State at end of session

**jepa-learning-order:** 2 sorries. Aristotle job `f9906716` (frozen_encoder_convergence, non-existential reformulation) was QUEUED as of last session — status unknown, check next session.

**simplicial-latent-geometry:** 13 sorries. OQ-6 NOT fixed. Aristotle job NOT submitted. Next session: fix OQ-6 first, then submit Aristotle job for matchRadius chain.

**stochastic-search-bounds:** 0 sorries. Focus project. Two submission blockers: .bib file + LaTeX conversion.

### What to do next session (priority order)
1. **simplicial OQ-6:** Move `incBeta_*` + `volumeFill_div_volumeEmpty_le_one_ge2` block to before line 2296 in `SimplicialDetection.lean` so `volumeFill_div_le_one'` can reference it. Then `lake build` to verify.
2. **simplicial Aristotle submit:** After OQ-6 fixed, submit matchRadius chain. Run `python scripts/submit.py my_theorems/proof_strategy.md "<prompt>" --dry-run` then for real. Prompt from OQ-3.
3. **stochastic .bib:** Convert 23 citations in `my_theorems/paper_draft.md` lines 430–467 to `references.bib` using author-year keys.
4. **stochastic LaTeX:** Convert `paper_draft.md` to `paper_draft.tex` with proper preamble + `\bibliography{references}`.
5. **jepa:** Check Aristotle job `f9906716` status. If complete, cherry-pick and wire (OQ-5).

## 2026-04-12 (session 1) — vacuous-proof fix, matchRadius definition fix, wiki knowledge absorption

### What was done

**JEPA — frozen_encoder_convergence non-existential reformulation:**
- Root-cause analysis of two consecutive vacuous Aristotle proofs (jobs `1afe6f24`, `315fff00`): any `∃ C > 0, ‖x‖ ≤ C * ε^r` conclusion allows trivial witness
- Reformulated `frozen_encoder_convergence` (JEPA.lean lines 886–916) to eliminate the existential: `K₀ K_qs c₀ : ℝ` are now plain hypotheses; conclusion is `matFrobNorm(V τ_A - quasiStaticDecoder dat W₀) ≤ (K₀ + K_qs) * ε^{2(L-1)/L}`
- 7-step PROVIDED SOLUTION written; build verified clean (8028 jobs)
- Submitted as Aristotle job `f9906716` (QUEUED as of 2026-04-12)
- Committed: `b2b692a`

**Simplicial — matchRadius definition corrected:**
- Identified bug: old definition solved Euclidean ball volume equation (wrong for sup-norm torus)
- Fixed to `r = p^(1/d)/2` (exact formula for sup-norm torus with filling density p)
- Added `matchRadius_spec` (line 505), replaced `matchRadius_tendsto_atTop` with `matchRadius_tendsto_half` (line 1275), re-sorry'd downstream asymptotic lemmas with PROVIDED SOLUTION blocks
- Sorry count: 10 → 13 (all new sorries annotated); Aristotle job NOT yet submitted
- Committed: `77ab5d2`

**Wiki bootstrapped and knowledge absorbed:**
- Created `wiki/` with: `INDEX.md`, `session-log.md`, `decisions.md`, `open-questions.md`, `lean4-reference.md`, `aristotle-strategy.md`
- Absorbed `Lean 4 Mathlib Patterns.md`, `Lean 4 Proofs.md`, `lean4-proofs.skill` → deleted originals
- Gutted `stochastic-proofs-handbook/docs/`, `templates/`, `archive/` → wiki is now the knowledge layer

**Repo rename:**
- `theorem-agents/` renamed to `stochastic-search-bounds/` locally and on GitHub
- Meta-narrative: the project proves that Aristotle-assisted stochastic search has bounded, guaranteed progress

**Open questions tracked:**
- OQ-3: simplicial Aristotle submission (matchRadius chain) — pending
- OQ-5: jepa `frozen_encoder_convergence` wiring after `f9906716` lands
- OQ-6: simplicial forward-ref sorry at line 2296
- OQ-7: publication venue strategy (three-paper structure)

### State at end of session

**jepa-learning-order:** 2 named sorries (`bootstrap_consistency` — permanent; `frozen_encoder_convergence` — Aristotle job `f9906716` QUEUED). Temporal re-indexing gap identified: V(τ_A) → V(0) wiring needed for Phase B. Paper abstract update deferred.

**simplicial-latent-geometry:** 13 sorries. matchRadius definition correct. Asymptotic chain ready for Aristotle (submit first thing next session). Forward-ref sorry at line 2296 tracked as OQ-6.

**stochastic-search-bounds:** 0 sorries. All 4 AND-OR hypertree theorems proved. GitHub renamed.

### What to do next session
1. Submit simplicial Aristotle job: `cd simplicial-latent-geometry && python scripts/submit.py my_theorems/strategy2.md "Prove the matchRadius asymptotic chain..." --dry-run` then for real
2. Check on JEPA Aristotle job `f9906716` — if COMPLETE, cherry-pick and wire into `JEPA_rho_ordering` (OQ-5)
3. Fix forward-ref sorry `volumeFill_div_le_one'` at line 2296 — move proof block earlier (OQ-6)
4. Update JEPA paper abstract once `frozen_encoder_convergence` lands

---

## 2026-04-11 (session 0) — wiki bootstrap + CLAUDE.md update

### What was done
- Updated workspace `CLAUDE.md`: fixed outdated workspace layout (was `automated-proofs/`), added `jepa-learning-order/`, `stochastic-search-bounds/`, `stochastic-proofs-handbook/`; added note about per-project scripts vs shared root scripts
- Bootstrapped `wiki/` (this file, `INDEX.md`, `decisions.md`, `open-questions.md`)
- Added wiki usage protocol to `CLAUDE.md`

### State at end of session

**jepa-learning-order:** 1 sorry remains (`bootstrap_consistency` — explicit regularity hypothesis, named by convention, no attempt to close in Lean). `contraction_ode_structure` proved (Aristotle `020b76be`). `contractive_gronwall_decay` genuine proof (Aristotle `1afe6f24`). `frozen_encoder_convergence` vacuous (C_A not ε-independent). Paper draft needs abstract update.

**simplicial-latent-geometry:** 7 sorries. 2 Aristotle jobs in flight:
- `60e73ec0` — `disjoint_triangles_indepFun`
- `b91c8747` — `volumeFill_div_volumeEmpty_le_one_ge2`

`matchRadius` formula is wrong for the unit sup-norm torus (see `open-questions.md`). File has ~20 pre-existing build errors (forward refs, `exact?` placeholders, post-refactor breakage).

**stochastic-search-bounds:** AND-OR hypertree hitting-time theorems. Sorry count not checked this session.

### What to do next session
1. Run `python scripts/status.py` in each project to get current sorry counts
2. Check email / run `python scripts/retrieve.py` for `simplicial-latent-geometry` jobs
3. Decide on `matchRadius` torus metric (sup-norm vs L2) — needed before touching asymptotics
4. Update `jepa-learning-order` paper abstract (fast, high impact)
