### Handbook
`stochastic-proofs-handbook/` is scripts-only. All knowledge is in this wiki.

### Paper drafts — naming convention
Each lean project has a canonical paper draft at `my_theorems/paper_draft.md`. Supporting docs sit alongside it.
- `jepa-learning-order/my_theorems/paper_draft.md` — "Conditional" title, 767L source (v2)
- `jepa-learning-order/my_theorems/paper.tex` — LaTeX, **14pp, compiles clean (session 24); `\leanverified{…}` catalog + Appendix B axiom status**
- `stochastic-search-bounds/my_theorems/paper_draft.md` — Manuscript v6 source
- `stochastic-search-bounds/my_theorems/paper.tex` — LaTeX, **18pp, compiles clean (session 23: Winston-star rewrite); Appendix A Lean verification catalog + Appendix B Lean signatures**
- `simplicial-latent-geometry/my_theorems/paper_draft.md` — Strategy 2 draft, §5 updated
- `simplicial-latent-geometry/my_theorems/paper.tex` — LaTeX, **16pp (session 20); all `\lean{}`/`\leanverified{}` pointers resolve to sorry-free lemmas; compiles clean**
- `simplicial-latent-geometry/my_theorems/proof_strategy.md` — active proof strategy (481L)

### Workspace repo
`lean-projects/` is now `davidcagoh/lean-workspace` (private) — tracks wiki/, scripts/, stochastic-proofs-handbook/, CLAUDE.md. The three proof projects are excluded (.gitignore) and remain independent repos.

## Open Questions

### OQ-14: JEPA — Job B `pd_lower_from_offDiag` ✅ DONE (session 28)

Job `53f7f1b1` landed. Proof via Frobenius submultiplicativity + Gershgorin det ≠ 0.
Key finding: hypothesis strengthened from `δ*√d < c_w/2` to `δ*(d-1) < c_w`.
PDLowerHelpers.lean added with 6 helper lemmas. Build clean.
paper.tex already reflects `δ(d-1) < c_w` at lines 661 and 1593. No further action.

---

### OQ-13: JEPA — Aristotle Job A `697611e0` ✅ DONE (session 26)

Both sorries proved and cherry-picked into `BootstrapLemmas.lean`:
- `offDiag_ftc` — proved via compactness on compact interval [0, t_max] (fun_prop + IsCompact.exists_bound_of_continuousOn)
- `tracking_bound_from_gronwall` — proved via `contractive_gronwall_decay` + `Real.rpow_sub` arithmetic

Note: `offDiag_ftc` proof uses a compactness bound (K may depend on ε); mathematically sufficient for the existential but K is not ε-independent. `hoff_small` can be derived in `JEPA_rho_ordering` once Job B (`pd_lower_from_offDiag`) also lands.

---

### OQ-12: stochastic-search-bounds — T2 `hcorrect_better` weakening (design-before-submit)

Before submitting to Aristotle, pick a concrete weaker sufficient condition. Candidates:
1. **Locality:** require ordering only at OR nodes on actual proof paths.
2. **Greedy-wrt-value:** require `π'` greedy wrt per-subtree `V(T) = successProb(π', T, ·)`.
3. **Zero-on-incorrect:** require `π'(nid, i) = 0` for incorrect children.

Option 2 is the cleanest research target. Action: pick one, formalise, scaffold, submit.

---

### OQ-11: stochastic-search-bounds — Aristotle Job `fc0719d6` (T4 sharp regime)

Submitted 2026-04-24 (session 22). Target: `sum_prod_erase_le_one_of_sum_le_one` and `sequential_le_parallel_sharp` in `Theorem4_Strong.lean`, replacing `q(i) ≤ 1/2` with sharp `∑ q(i) ≤ 1`.
Retrieve: `python scripts/retrieve.py`. On success: upgrade Prop 4.15 to sharp form.

---

### OQ-7: Publication strategy — venue targets for all three papers

1. **JEPA** → ICLR theory / COLT / TMLR (arXiv-ready; 1 sorry remaining in JEPA.lean)
2. **Stochastic-search-bounds** → ITP / CPP 2026 (0 sorries; confirm deadline first)
3. **Simplicial** → RSA via Wiley ScholarOne after arXiv ID assigned
4. **Methodology paper** ("Aristotle-Assisted Formalization") → NeurIPS / ITP (all three as case studies)

---

### OQ-16: simplicial — pre-arXiv expansion (Cook request, 2026-04-30)

Nick Cook wants two extensions before arXiv:
1. **Low-degree optimality** of τ_f (BB24-style for the simplicial setting).
2. **Sparse regime** `p → 0` / `p = p(d)` (LMSY 2111.11316 model).

Roadmap: `simplicial-latent-geometry/my_theorems/roadmap_pre_arxiv.md`.

**Track A — DONE pen-and-paper (session 31).** `analytic_decay_rate.md`:
- `\phi(1/3 - \epsilon) = 1 - 36\epsilon^2` *exactly* on `[0, 1/12]` (Stevens 1939).
- `1 - fillingP(p,d) = 4\log(3/2)\,|\log p|\,\eta^2(1+O(\eta))`, `\eta = 1 - d/d^*(p)`.
- 8-term `geomCov` collapse: `geomCov = (1-q)\gamma^d + 3p^3[(7r/2)^d - q]`. Wedge term vanishes by 1D Helly.
- Final rate: `geomCov ≍ (1-q)\gamma(r)^d ≍ (3/4)^d p^2` deep in regime.
- Sparse threshold: `p_n \gg n^{-3/4}` for fixed `d`.

**Status (session 31, end):**
- ✅ 5 Lean stubs landed in `SimplicialDetection.lean` (lines 691–820), build clean.
- ✅ **Aristotle Job 1 (sim-A5-primitives) IN FLIGHT: `43761387-672d-4007-9a74-aefd8efb068d`.** Targets `wedge_implies_fill`, `gamma_pow_eq`, `mu_e_pow_eq`, `fillingProb_eq_low_r`. Email-on-completion.
- ✅ Paper deltas drafted in `my_theorems/paper_delta_OQ16.md` (§5.1 quantitative decay, §5.2 sparse corollary, §5.3 low-degree, §5.4 sub-regime open problem, Stevens 1939 bib entry).
- ⚠️ **Decision Point 2 hit (Track C C3, session 31).** Pure-fill pair statistic `τ_ff = ∑_{shared-edge t,t'} (F_t-q)(F_{t'}-q)` appears to beat `τ_f` by `n^{1/2} · 2.07^d` in the deep regime — see `fourier_setup.md` §C3-C4. If correct, **τ_f is NOT low-degree optimal**; the paper's planned §5.3 "Theorem 6.1: τ_f optimal" must be reframed to "there exists a strictly better test". Calculation needs independent verification before telling Cook.

**Next (when Aristotle returns):**
1. `python ../stochastic-proofs-handbook/scripts/retrieve.py` for job `43761387`.
2. Cherry-pick PASS into `SimplicialDetection.lean`, `lake build`, commit.
3. Submit Job 2 (sim-A5-assembly: `geometricCov_eq_deep`, `geometricCov_decay_rate_le`).
4. **Verify τ_{ff} > τ_f finding** — check arithmetic in `fourier_setup.md` §C3-C4 by hand, then numerically.
5. If verified, draft revised §5.3 + send Cook a note describing the new test.

### OQ-6: simplicial — `volumeFill_div_le_one'` forward-reference sorry (line 2296)

Forward reference to `volumeFill_div_volumeEmpty_le_one` (line 3479) — Lean 4 rejects. Fix: move `incBeta_*` block earlier in the file (Option A) or duplicate inline (Option B). Not an Aristotle job.

---

### OQ-1: Paper submission venue for `jepa-learning-order`

Strategic advice in `jepa-learning-order/CLAUDE.md` recommends submitting soon — "first machine-checked learning-dynamics result" claim has time value. One named sorry (`bootstrap_consistency`) is a strong position.

---

### OQ-17: JEPA — close conceptual gap (dynamics-level ordering) — **NEW (session 31)**

User's goal: prove that the *actual* JEPA training dynamics obey the
$\rho^*$-ordering, not just the formula-level ordering. Audit of Section 6
of the paper draft against Littwin 2024 (`literature/2407.03475v1.pdf`,
Theorem 4.5) revealed the previous formula
$\tilde t^* \approx L/(\lambda\rho^{2L-2}\varepsilon^{1/L})$ is the n=1
Laurent term (not leading); leading is $L/((2L-1)\lambda\varepsilon^{(2L-1)/L})$,
$\rho$-independent. Ordering enters at the n=1 term as predicted.
Section 6 rewritten to drop Prediction 6.1 in favour of four target
theorems. Five Lean stubs added; full proof plan in
`jepa-learning-order/my_theorems/strongest_result_roadmap.md`. Aristotle
Jobs E, F.1, F.2, F.3, G + assembly form the path to closing it.

**In flight:** Job G `actual_critical_time` (`862881a0`).

---

*Resolved: OQ-15 (uniform_pd_lower_from_compactness Job C, session 30), OQ-14 (pd_lower_from_offDiag Job B, session 28), OQ-13 (Job A offDiag_ftc + tracking_bound, session 26), OQ-10 (chebyshev_ratio, session 19), OQ-9 (geomCov, session 11), OQ-8 (fillingProb, session 9), OQ-5 (frozen_encoder_convergence, session 20), OQ-3 (matchRadius, session 6), OQ-2 (SSB sorry count, session early) — see session-log for details.*

---

## Next Priorities

1. **JEPA — retrieve Job G `862881a0`** (`actual_critical_time`) when Aristotle emails. `cd jepa-learning-order && python ../stochastic-proofs-handbook/scripts/retrieve.py 862881a0-...`
2. **JEPA — cherry-pick G** into `JEPA.lean`, `lake build`, commit.
3. **JEPA — assemble `JEPA_dynamics_ordering`** in `MainTheorem.lean` once G lands (all of E, F.1–F.3, G now done). (Opus-level — see roadmap.)
4. **JEPA — Aristotle job D:** Derive `hDrift_bound` from chain rule on `quasiStaticDecoder` + `hWbar_slow`; removes it from `JEPA_rho_ordering'`. (Lower priority — not blocking the dynamics-ordering goal.)
5. **JEPA — wire `hPhaseA`:** Add `quasiStaticDecoder_norm_bound` helper + apply `frozen_encoder_convergence` inside `JEPA_rho_ordering'`; removes `hPhaseA` from signature.

## Pickup notes for fresh agent (2026-04-30, after session 34)

**Context to load on session start:**
- This file (`wiki/INDEX.md`) — status + open questions + next priorities.
- `wiki/session-log.md` top entry — session 34 wrap (F.3 landed, G submitted).
- `jepa-learning-order/my_theorems/strongest_result_roadmap.md` — full proof plan for the dynamics-level ordering theorem.
- `jepa-learning-order/my_theorems/paper.tex` Section 6 — the theorem statements being formalised.
- Aristotle id in flight: `862881a0` (Job G `actual_critical_time`).

**Mathematical context to know:**
- The audit revealed the previous draft's "leading critical time" formula was actually the n=1 Laurent term (smallest), not the leading one. Littwin 2024 Theorem 4.5 has the correct form. Don't get confused if old comments in JEPA.lean still reference the old formula.
- **Coefficient correction (session 33):** `jepa_bernoulli_solution` coefficient is `σ_xx * ρ^(2L)` NOT `σ_xx * ρ^(2L)/L`. The L in the ODE cancels with 1/L from the chain rule on wbar^{1/L}. Old wrong statement is preserved in a block comment in JEPA.lean for reference.
- **diagAmp_ODE (session 33):** Three new hypotheses `hflow_diag`, `hWbar_cont`, `hV_cont` were added (mirror offDiag_ODE regularity inputs). These are present in any downstream use.
- The dynamics-level ordering proof uses a monotone-comparison sandwich on autonomous scalar ODEs — *not* an ODE blow-up argument as earlier drafts speculated.
- Lean note: `w̄` (combining bar) breaks the parser — use `wbar` instead.

**Current sorry inventory (2 total, all intentional):**
1. `JEPA.lean` `actual_critical_time` — Job G (in flight `862881a0`).
2. `MainTheorem.lean` `JEPA_dynamics_ordering` — final assembly.

**Build status:** `lake build` succeeds (8028 jobs).

A Sonnet agent can run the workflow autonomously: retrieve → cherry-pick → submit next → repeat. Request docs `24_*` through `28_*` contain the reference proofs.
3. **JEPA — arXiv upload:** 15pp paper.tex compiles clean, 0 sorries. Ship now.
4. **Stochastic-search-bounds — arXiv upload:** 18pp ready. Confirm OQ-7 (ITP/CPP 2026 deadline) first.
5. **Simplicial — OQ-16 expansion (pre-arXiv):** see roadmap. Start with Track A (geomCov decay rate, A1–A3 pen-and-paper) + Track C steps C1–C2 in parallel.
6. **Simplicial — RSA submission:** PDF via Wiley ScholarOne after OQ-16 lands and arXiv ID assigned.
7. **Forward-cites triage (SSB):** Boige-Boumaza-Scherrer, Ito-Suzuki 2024, Chrestien-Pevný-Edelkamp 2023 flagged.
